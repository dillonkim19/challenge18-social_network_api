DESCRIPTION
-----------
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

This backend application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
The following tools are used: Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 
Specifically, the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
## Setup (if git and node are already installed, you may skip): 

For Windows, please download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users will need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then, run `brew install git` to install git, and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way.

After that, [clone the Application](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

When the cloning is done, open the Integrated Terminal in the respective directory. 

Run the following command in the terminal to install the packages: 

```bash
npm install
```

This app uses Mongoose so installing MongoDB, that is also part of the setup. 

To send the API calls, it would be very useful to download an API client (ie. Insomnia)

## Using the Application

Run the following command in the terminal to run the application: 

```bash
npm run start
```
Now, you may go into your API client to send your API calls as shown in the walkthrough video further below this README.
